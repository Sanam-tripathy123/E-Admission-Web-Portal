        Our University has been established with a vision to contribute to nation-building through education by developing industry-ready graduates who are technically focused, socially sensitive and ethically sound. The university follows the core philosophy of achieving academic excellence through industry integration, internalization and research. The teaching and learning method adopted by the university includes both traditional and contemporary techniques. Adequate practical exposure is provided to the students through Industry visits, research projects, case-based teaching and field exposure.
